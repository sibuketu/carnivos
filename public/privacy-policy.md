# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 1, 2026

Primal Logic ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclosure, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.

## 1. Information We Collect

We utilize a "Privacy First" approach. Wherever possible, data is processed locally on your device or stored securely associated with your authenticated user ID.

### A. Personal Data
We may collect personally identifiable information, such as:
- Name / Username
- Email address (for authentication and support)
- User ID (assigned by our authentication provider)

### B. Health and Fitness Data
To provide the core functionality of the App (Carnivore Diet tracking and analysis), we collect:
- **Body Measurements:** Weight, Height, Body Fat Percentage.
- **Dietary Data:** Food intake, nutrient calculations, meal timing.
- **Lifestyle Data:** Sleep hours, sun exposure time, activity levels.
- **Symptoms:** User-reported physical or mental symptoms for analysis.

### C. Financial Data
Financial information, such as data related to your payment method (e.g., valid credit card number, card brand, expiration date), is handled by our third-party payment processor (Stripe). We do not store complete financial information on our servers.

## 2. Use of Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Create and manage your account.
- Calculate personalized nutrient targets based on your metabolic data.
- Analyze your diet and provide AI-driven feedback (e.g., "Primal Logic" insights).
- Process payments and manage subscriptions.
- Improve the App's algorithms and accuracy.
- Respond to customer service requests and support needs.

## 3. Disclosure of Your Information

We do **not** sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your personal health data with third parties for marketing purposes.

We may share information in the following situations:
- **Service Providers:** With third-party vendors who perform services for us (e.g., payment processing via Stripe, authentication via Supabase, AI processing). These vendors are obligated to protect your data.
- **Legal Requirements:** If required by law or to respond to legal process.

## 4. Security of Your Information

We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest where applicable. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.

## 5. Policy for Children

We do not knowingly solicit information from or market to children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.

## 6. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
